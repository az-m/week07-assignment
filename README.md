# Requirements

Create a client using React.
Use Express to create your server, using both GET and POST endpoints.
Build a React form for users to create posts.
Create multiple pages using React Router.
Design a database schema, and seed the database with some realistic data.
Use SQL to retrieve posts from the database in your Express server.
Display all posts using .map().
Use an interval and useEffect() to poll your database.

# Reflections

There were more that a few frustrations through putting this together, although I think it all works in the end. I'm honestly running out of time to write this README because I'm being early-deadlined by yet another concert (for the third weekend in a row), so apologies if I don't go it all the details.

Highlight was wasting most of Friday afternoon because I didn't notice I used the wrong property on a select element. Much joy!

And yes, this actually is my real gaming backlog (the PC section at least). I had all this data on a spreadsheet, so I thought I may as well use it for the assignment. What do you suggest I play next?
